# Nand2Tetris-
Repository of project I have completed for the Nand2Tetris course. 

This course was reated by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. For more information visit https://www.nand2tetris.org/.

The aim of this course is to build a modern computer from first principals. A brief decription of each completed project
is given below. 

Project 1: Boolean Logic. Build a set of elementary logic gates which will serve as the fondation for 
hardware components going forward. 

Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic. Build chips to complete binary arithmetic including an ALU. 

Project 3: Sequential Logic. Build RAM chips with up to 16k register. 

Project 4: Machine Language. Introduction to Assembly and Machine language. Write programs in machine language to complete
simple tasks in CPU Emulator. 

Project 5: Computer Architecure: Build a CPU and RAM by the specifications of Hack machine language. Connect to complete 
hardware aspect of the course. 

Project 6: Assembler. Write an assembler to translate assembly into machine language. Assembler is written in Python.
